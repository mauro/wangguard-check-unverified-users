This plug-in adds a tool to check unverified users against the WuangGuard protection API. Requires the WuangGuard Plug-in to be active and setup with an API key.

== Description ==

The WuangGuard plug-in will check new subscribers at registration time agains a centralized database, and report fake users, bot users or spam users as "sploggers". It can be setup to remove such users from your WordPress site too.

That plug-in has a wizard that will check your existing userbase against the WuangGuard Database through their API.

You usually do NOT need this tool. This plug-in solves a very specific purpose: in case the WangGuard Wizard won't verify all users during your first run, and you don't wish to check the whole uservase from scratch the next time you run it.

Please understand this plug-in is a tool that extends WuangGuard. First, you should setup and use WangGuard and only if you have the need to check unverified users without getting the whole userbase checked again, then you may find this tool useful.
